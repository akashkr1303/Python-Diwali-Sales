# Diwali-Sales-Analysis

## Project Overview:
The Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to analyze sales data during the Diwali festival period. The dataset contains information about customers' gender, age group, state, marital status, occupation, product category, and sales amount. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights that can help understand customer behavior and improve sales strategies.

## Data Preparation:
Loaded the dataset from a CSV file and examined its structure and contents.
Removed irrelevant columns (Status, unnamed1) and dropped rows with missing values to clean the data.
Converted the Amount column to integer data type for further analysis.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed the distribution of orders and sales by gender, age group, state, marital status, occupation, and product category.
Identified key insights such as:
Women place more orders than men and have a higher purchasing power.
The age group (26-35) spends the most.
Most orders and sales come from states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
Unmarried women make the most orders.
The clothing & apparel category is the most ordered, but the food category generates the most revenue.


## Visualization:
Used various visualization techniques including count plots and bar plots to present the analysis findings effectively.
Created visualizations to compare sales and orders across different categories, highlighting trends and patterns.


## Conclusion:
The analysis of Diwali sales data provides valuable insights for business decision-making. Understanding customer demographics and preferences can help tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to improve sales during festive seasons like Diwali.
